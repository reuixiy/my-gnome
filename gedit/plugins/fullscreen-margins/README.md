===================================

The plugin adds margins around text in the fullscreen mode. This makes text
centered in a column with a comfortable width of around 80 characters. By
avoiding too long lines, it allows to turn Gedit into "distraction free editor".

**Installation:**
Copy files `fullscreen_margins.plugin` and `fullscreen_margins.py` to
`~/.local/share/gedit/plugins` and enable plugin in Gedit preferences.
